## ‚ú® Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Detection Engine

* ‚ö° **Time-based SQL Injection detection** via precise `sleep(n)` delta measurement.
* üßê **Drift-tolerant detection** using `-negdrift` / `-posdrift` to handle real-world network jitter.
* ‚ùå **False-positive control** with `-maxtime` to skip outliers.
* üö¶ **Stop-at-first-match** with `-spm` to minimize redundant testing.

### üß™ Payload Handling

* üéØ **Dynamic payloads** using `{SLEEP}` placeholders, automatically replaced at runtime.
* üåê **Auto-encoding** for payloads with spaces unless `-encode` is explicitly set.
* üì• **Payload validation**: skips empty lines, comments (`#`), and lines without `{SLEEP}`.
* üîß Debug output for ignored/auto-encoded payloads (line number, reason).

### üåê Request Customization

* üîÅ Supports **GET** and **POST** methods with `-post` flag.
* üë§ Custom **User-Agent** string via `-user-agent`.
* üé≠ **User-Agent header injection** (`-add-ua`) to test payloads through headers.
* üìÇ Support for multiple **custom headers** with `-header "Key:Value"`.

### üîó Proxy & Replay

* üîó Full **proxy support** with `-proxy`.
* üîÅ **Replay proxy** for vulnerable findings only (`-replay-proxy`).
* üõ†Ô∏è Modular replay engine supports full POST replay with correct content types and headers.

### üßµ Performance & Control

* üßµ **Multi-threaded scanning** using `-threads` to control concurrency.
* üí§ Adjustable **delay between requests** with `-delay`, applies to base and payloads.
* ‚è≥ **Adaptive timeout** calculated using `sleep * timeoutmultiplier + timeoutbuffer`.

### üßº Output & UX

* üßπ **Clean mode** (`-clean`) to output only vulnerable URLs (ideal for piping).
* üîî Integration with **ProjectDiscovery notify** for real-time alerts (`-notify`).
* üîß **Color-coded debug logs** with detailed CLI feedback (`-debug`).
* üìõ **Legend, banners, and prefixes** for clean, readable output.

### üì• Input Validation

* üö´ Skips **invalid or malformed URLs** from stdin (with debug messages).
* ‚úÖ Ensures payloads in file are syntactically valid and informative when skipped.

## üì¶ Installation

Requires **Go 1.18+**

```bash
go install github.com/c1phy/sqltimer/cmd/sqltimer@latest
```

The binary `sqltimer` will be available in your `$GOBIN` directory.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Prepare a list of target URLs

Each URL must contain at least one GET parameter:

```txt
https://target.com/page?id=1
https://site.org/search?q=test
```

Save as `urls.txt`.

---

### 2. Create your payloads (with `{SLEEP}` placeholder)

```txt
(select*from(select(sleep({SLEEP}))a)
' OR sleep({SLEEP}) --
1') AND SLEEP({SLEEP}) AND ('1'='1
" OR sleep({SLEEP})) --
```

Save as `payloads.txt`.

> `{SLEEP}` will be replaced dynamically based on the `-sleep` parameter, e.g., `sleep(10)`

---

### 3. Run the scan

```bash
cat urls.txt | sqltimer -payloads payloads.txt -sleep 10 -threads 20 -encode -notify
```

---

## üìÅ Example Directory Structure

```
sqltimer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payloads.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ urls.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sqltimer (binary from go install or build)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Example Output

```bash
üî• SQLi suspicion in param 'q' with payload '(select*from(select(sleep(10)))a)' ‚Üí https://example.com/search?q=test (Œî=10.2s ‚âà 1x sleep ¬±0.1s/0.5s)
```

## üéØ How Drift Works (`-negdrift` and `-posdrift`)

The `-negdrift` and `-posdrift` options define how much timing deviation is tolerated when matching the sleep time against the server's real delay.

### ‚úçÔ∏è Example

- `-sleep 2`
- `-negdrift 0.1`
- `-posdrift 0.5`

### üìä Drift Detection Table

| Expected Sleep | Match Range    | Observed Delta | Detected? | Reason                          |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| 2√ó1 (2s)       | 1.9s - 2.5s     | 2.3s           | ‚úÖ         | within 1x sleep window          |
| 2√ó2 (4s)       | 3.9s - 4.5s     | 3.9s           | ‚úÖ         | within 2x sleep window          |
| 2√ó2 (4s)       | 3.9s - 4.5s     | 4.3s           | ‚úÖ         | within 2x sleep window          |
| 2√ó3 (6s)       | 5.9s - 6.5s     | 5.7s           | ‚ùå         | too far off, not matching       |
| 2√ó3 (6s)       | 5.9s - 6.5s     | 6.4s           | ‚úÖ         | within 3x sleep window          |
| 2√ó4 (8s)       | 7.9s - 8.5s     | 7.5s           | ‚ùå         | too far off, not matching       |

## ‚è≥ How HTTP Timeout Works

Sqltimer dynamically sets the HTTP client timeout based on your `-sleep` parameter:

```
timeout = (sleep √ó timeoutmultiplier) + timeoutbuffer
```

Example:
- `-sleep 2`
- `-timeoutmultiplier 6`
- `-timeoutbuffer 10`

Resulting Timeout:
```bash
(2 √ó 6) + 10 = 22 seconds
```

This ensures slow SQLi payloads are not cut off prematurely but keeps the scanner responsive.

---

## üîî Integration with `notify` (optional)

Install [`notify`](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/notify):

```bash
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/notify/cmd/notify@latest
```

Configure it (Slack, Discord, Telegram) via `~/.config/notify/provider-config.yaml`.

Then simply use:

```bash
cat urls.txt | sqltimer -payloads payloads.txt -notify
```

All matches will be piped into your `notify` pipeline automatically.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Usage Tips

### üéØ Detection Accuracy

* Use a higher `-sleep` value (e.g., `10`) for more reliable detection.
* For stable networks, keep default drift settings: `-negdrift 0.1` and `-posdrift 0.5`.
* In noisy environments (e.g., cloud targets), increase `-posdrift` slightly (e.g., `0.6`) to reduce false negatives.
* Use `-debug` to trace timing behavior and fine-tune drift or delays.

### üß™ Payload Strategies

* Enable `-add-ua` to test payloads in the **User-Agent** header.
* Switch to `-post` if GET-based payloads are filtered or blocked by the server.
* Use `-spm` (stop-after-match) to reduce noise and scan faster by skipping further payloads once a hit is found.

### üîó Integration & Automation

* Pipe input from tools like [`waybackurls`](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls), [`gau`](https://github.com/lc/gau), or [`ffuf`](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).
* Combine with `-clean` for chaining into other tools:

  ```bash
  sqltimer ... -clean | awk '{print $1}'
  ```

### üåê Proxy & Replay

* Use `-proxy` to send **all** traffic through a proxy (e.g., Burp/ZAP).
* Use `-replay-proxy` to send only detected **vulnerable requests** through a secondary proxy for logging, inspection, or exploitation.
* If both are specified, `-proxy` takes precedence and is used for all traffic.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

* Set a custom `-user-agent` to blend in or bypass basic filters.
* Use `-header "Key:Value"` one or more times to add arbitrary HTTP headers (e.g., auth tokens, X-Forwarded-For).
* Use `-delay` to slow down scanning for unstable targets or rate-limited endpoints (e.g., `-delay 2`).
